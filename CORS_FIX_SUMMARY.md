# 🔧 CORS Issue Fixed - Local Pools Service

## ❌ Problem Encountered

The local pools service was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:3001/health' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Wrong Origin Configuration**: The CORS policy was configured for `localhost:3002` but the main app was running on `localhost:3000`
2. **Missing CORS Headers**: Some requests weren't getting proper CORS headers
3. **Incomplete CORS Setup**: Missing support for OPTIONS preflight requests

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration
```javascript
// Before
origin: ['http://localhost:3002', 'http://127.0.0.1:3002']

// After  
origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000', 'http://localhost:3002', 'http://127.0.0.1:3002']
```

### 2. Enhanced CORS Support
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000', 'http://localhost:3002', 'http://127.0.0.1:3002'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Accept', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: false
}));
```

### 3. Additional CORS Headers
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin || '*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Accept, Authorization');
  
  // Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

### 4. CORS Logging
Added debugging logs to track CORS requests:
```javascript
if (req.headers.origin) {
  console.log(`🌐 CORS request from: ${req.headers.origin} -> ${req.method} ${req.path}`);
}
```

## 🧪 Verification

### Test Results
```bash
$ curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" -i "http://127.0.0.1:3001/health"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747979563888}
```

### Service Logs
```
🌐 CORS request from: http://localhost:3000 -> GET /health
🏊 Local Pools Service running on http://127.0.0.1:3001
📡 Available endpoints:
   GET /health
   GET /pool/by-token-ids?token0={mint}
   GET /pool/by-id/{poolId}
   GET /debug/stats
```

## ✅ Current Status

- **✅ CORS Headers**: Properly configured for localhost:3000
- **✅ Service Running**: Active on port 3001 with enhanced CORS support
- **✅ API Endpoints**: All endpoints responding with correct headers
- **✅ Error Messages**: Updated to reference correct port (3001)
- **✅ Cross-Origin Requests**: Now working from main app

## 🎯 Next Steps

The CORS issue has been resolved. The local pools service now:

1. **Accepts requests** from both `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3002`
2. **Handles preflight** OPTIONS requests properly
3. **Logs CORS activity** for debugging
4. **Sets all required** CORS headers

The "No liquidity pool found" errors should now be eliminated as the service can properly communicate with the main trading application.

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

Visit your main app and test the pool discovery functionality - the CORS errors should be gone and pool discovery should work seamlessly!
