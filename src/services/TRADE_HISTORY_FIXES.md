# Trading History Database Fixes

## Issue Identified

The trading history system had several issues that were preventing trades from being properly stored in the Supabase database:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The code was trying to insert fields that don't exist in the database schema
2. **Missing Required Fields**: Some required fields were not being included in the insert operations
3. **Batch Processing Issues**: Large trade batches were potentially overwhelming the database
4. **Missing Wallet Status Updates**: The tracked_wallets table wasn't being consistently updated

## Table Schema

The actual `trading_history` table schema is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE trading_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  signature TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  token_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  token_name TEXT,
  amount NUMERIC,
  price_usd NUMERIC,
  price_sol NUMERIC,
  action TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  source TEXT,
  UNIQUE(wallet_address, signature, token_address)
);
# Trade History Service Fixes

## Historical Price Service Improvements

### Issues Fixed

1. **Supabase SQL Error**
   - Original error: `ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "const"`
   - Root cause: TypeScript code was being run directly in the SQL editor instead of through the proper API
   - Fix: Implemented proper API methods for storing and retrieving trade data

2. **Missing Historical Prices**
   - Trades were being saved without accurate historical price data
   - Historical SOL prices weren't being correctly associated with transactions
   - Added caching system for SOL prices to improve performance

3. **Incomplete Trade Data**
   - Some transactions weren't being properly identified as trades
   - Trade detection logic improved to catch more valid trades

### Key Improvements

1. **New Storage Methods**
   - Added `storeTrade` method for reliable insertion of trades into trading_history table
   - Implemented `updateTradePrice` method for updating existing trades with accurate prices
   - Created `refreshAllHistoricalPrices` function to periodically update historical price data

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the historical price service
   - Improved logging for better debugging and monitoring
   - Implemented retry mechanisms for transient API failures

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented multi-level caching for token metadata and SOL prices
   - Reduced redundant API calls to external services
   - Added batch processing for large transaction sets

4. **Improved Token Account Discovery**
   - Enhanced deep scanning to discover all associated token accounts
   - Better tracking of token account ownership
   - Added recursion control to prevent infinite loops in token account discovery

## Implementation Details

The historical price service now handles the complete lifecycle of trade data:

1. **Discovery**: Scans transactions to identify trades
2. **Validation**: Validates trades with improved filtering criteria
3. **Enrichment**: Adds token metadata and historical price information
4. **Storage**: Properly stores trades in the Supabase trading_history table
5. **Maintenance**: Periodically refreshes historical prices

## Usage

The service exposes the following methods:

- `analyzeWalletTrades(walletAddress)`: Main method to analyze trading history
- `storeTrade(tradeData)`: Store a validated trade in the database
- `updateTradePrice(signature, newPrice)`: Update price for an existing trade
- `refreshAllHistoricalPrices()`: Update all historical prices
- `clearWalletCache(walletAddress)`: Clear cache for a specific wallet
- `clearAllCaches()`: Clear all caches

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more sophisticated trade detection algorithms
2. Add support for additional DEXes and trading platforms
3. Improve historical price accuracy with multiple data sources
4. Add trade categorization and tagging capabilities
5. Implement advanced analytics and performance metrics
