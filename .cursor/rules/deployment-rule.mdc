Deployment-Only Patches
Mindset & Rationale:
Deployment incidents are often urgent and high-visibility. Senior engineers know that the fastest path to resolution is to target deployment scripts, Docker/K8s configs, CI pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code—without touching the site’s UI, business logic, or user-facing behavior.

Rule ID & Annotation (for Cursor):

ID: DEPLOYMENT_PATCH

Annotation: Place // @CursorRule(DEPLOYMENT_PATCH) at the top of any patch file or PR that should only modify deployment concerns. Cursor will parse this flag to scope its actions.

System Behavior Specifications:

Scope Locking:

When Cursor sees @CursorRule(DEPLOYMENT_PATCH), it restricts diffs to files matching deployment patterns (.github/workflows/*, Dockerfile*, helm/**, terraform/**, k8s/**, CI scripts).

Any attempt to modify a .tsx, .css, or business-logic .ts file causes Cursor to emit a “Scope Violation” warning and reject the change.

No UI or Logic Changes:

Cursor’s automated fixes must not alter HTML templates, React components, CSS classes, or API-service code outside of deployment glue.

Cursor enforces this by static analysis: blacklist AST nodes in src/ui/ and src/components/ when DEPLOYMENT_PATCH is active.

Integrity Checks:

After any deployment patch, Cursor runs smoke tests against a staging URL to confirm the site still builds, serves, and renders key pages (home, login, dashboard) with zero regressions.

Any visual diffs or HTTP 5xx errors in these endpoints cause an automatic rollback suggestion.

CI/CD Enforcement:

The CI pipeline scans PRs for @CursorRule(DEPLOYMENT_PATCH). If present:

Allow only modifications to deployment/IaC files.

Require passing of a “deployment linter” (e.g., terraform fmt, helm lint) and a successful staging deploy plus smoke-test job.

If any other file types are touched, the job fails with a clear message:

“PR flagged as DEPLOYMENT_PATCH must not modify application code or UI files.”

Rollback & Notification:

On post-deploy failure, Cursor triggers an automated rollback via the pipeline’s built-in rollback stage.

Sends a high-priority alert to the on-call channel with logs and a link to the failed deploy artifact.
